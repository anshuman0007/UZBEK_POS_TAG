Insights:
Class Performance:

Classes with 1.00 precision, recall, and F1-score (e.g., classes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14) indicate excellent performance. 
The model accurately identifies these classes without any false positives or negatives.
Classes with lower recall and F1-scores (e.g., classes 0, 10, 13, and 15) suggest that while precision is perfect, 
the model struggles to identify all instances of these classes:
Class 0: High precision but only 54% recall indicates that the model misses many actual instances.
Class 15: Very low recall (8%) and F1-score (15%) suggest significant room for improvement.
Micro, Macro, and Weighted Averages:

Micro Average: 1.00 precision indicates perfect classification overall, but the recall of 0.92 suggests some classes are being missed.
Macro Average: 1.00 precision is excellent, but a recall of 0.86 indicates that on average, the model has difficulties identifying all 
classes equally.
Weighted Average: 1.00 precision and a recall of 0.92 suggest the model performs well when accounting for class imbalance.
Conclusion:
Favorable Aspects: The model is highly effective for many classes, achieving perfect precision and strong F1-scores.
Unfavorable Aspects: There are several classes (especially 0, 10, 13, and 15) where the model needs improvement in recall.
 You might consider collecting more data for these classes, adjusting the model, or fine-tuning the parameters to improve 
 overall performance.
Overall, while the model performs well, focusing on the underperforming classes will lead to better overall accuracy 
and usability in practical applications.
